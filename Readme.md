Hello, this is my result, which I had fun with :)

The timeframe was not enought to complete everything, but at least I had time to think about how I would approach this.

It took me 2 hours and 16 minutes to get this far, I hope the outcome will be satisfactory enough.

Now because of the lack of time, there is no documentation to the code (almost at all). I can explain what my code does when we meet;
I remember you suggested that we will talk about it anyway if I remember correctly.

For the same reason I could not move some things into Controllers for example or impelement JWT authentication as I intended (I kind of expected that I would not manage that).

Unfortunately there was no time to complete the DELETE verb action either.

I did try and make the application like an API, even though it would need some rework to really be one; but it's close enough.

After stopping coding I created an export from Postman with a few examples of calls. You can find it in the project:
portaltech.postman_collection.json

I thought it would speed up things a little bit if you imported it and tried out the calls yourself.

Thanks in advance for your consideration.
